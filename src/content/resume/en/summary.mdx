    After graduating from university, I began my career as an IT consultant, working on new feature development and enterprise rollouts for <strong>Cyanoba</strong>, a decarbonization SaaS platform. I was responsible for the full lifecycle from requirements definition through design and testing. I then self‑studied computer science and joined <strong>AWS Japan</strong> as a Cloud Support Associate (Database), specializing in RDS, Aurora MySQL, and DMS. In that role, I investigated complex production issues, identified root causes, and proposed remediation and best practices to customers. Currently, I build and operate products using Rails, React, and AWS as a solo developer, and I am seeking my next role where I can deliver value across both the application and infrastructure layers.
